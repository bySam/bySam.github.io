##### Introduction
I have to make a strong preface here. This document is an inferior version of the Aimer7 guides, filled with inaccuracies, dumbing-downs, and my own poor thinkings. The Aimer guides: Strafe Aiming 101, Heuristic about geometric positioning, and also to some extent his and zorros tracer guide for some of Aimers writings on dodge, are very very very good. I've recommended them to every client I've coached, and everyone tells me they'll read them, the issue is: for some reason they never do. 
This document is written in a different style to aimers guides, hopefully better suited for the ADHD brains of semi-/pros. It will be soaked in artsy, "Art of War", flimsical bullshit. This is intentional to keep your attention, as is the fact that I won't talk any real technical details. View this document as an introduction to the topic, to awaken some thoughts and inspirations in you - but a document which indeed has to be complemented with the technical texts if you want to achieve real maturity.
Let me repeat myself: this document is to an overwhelming degree based on aimer's writings, and while I will quote him frequently and at length, it's always better to read the source material. If you're not an ADHD low iq, too afraid of LaTeX to spend a few hours understanding a slightly complicated text, **go read the fucking source material.**


##### Why practice your strafes?
First a note on the necessity and utility of improving your strafes. I am early to concede that strafing is not a big factor in the general success or lack thereof of any player, and as a natural extension it is of course true that you can “get by” well in your pro career with frankly poor strafing skill. But as a pro player your mentality should not be to just get by. If your mindset is to do the bare minimum to secure your little paycheck and validity, then you will never be truly good. Instead you should always look to seek out edges and strive to play as closely as you can to the ideal.  Despite this, it has been shown that in mechanics-heavy situations (firing range) people with good strafes, despite their low hours in apex, outperform top apex pros (see: serious’ results in various gdolphn tourneys) - and indeed people with just decent strafes will also outperform top pros in these situations (see: myself). What’s important in firing range compared to the real game is of course vastly different, and in a competitive game I perform around or slightly below the average pro in terms of mechanics. It should also be noted that as more variables are introduced to a situation (teammate, enemy, weapon, stack difference, ..) the possibility of strafe skill expression is increased, but it might not increase more than the possible skill expression of gamesense, f.e. From previous examples it nevertheless seems obvious to me that strafing ability has a non-trivial effect in-game. 

To paraphrase an analogy of LS: if you’re on an island of people only capable of simple arithmetic, it’s enough that you know basic algebra to dominate the population. And indeed we can look and see that top players like Hardecki and Nafen have much better strafing skill than their counterparts, and in the case of Hardecki the effect of MM seems to have been significant enough that I could scout him long before he was proven, while others didn’t see his potential (ask Jaazz, or AlexDoubleU if you’re old-school enough for him).

The argument now [[1](https://twitter.com/rondonstreams/status/1502027957153546248), not directly about MM, but applicable] is that even if you agree strafing has a non-trivial effect on performance, it’s indeed marginal, and time could surely be allocated to more effective areas. There are a few issues with this argument: one of what I call percentility, one of pragmatics, and one of unavailability. On percentility: it is easier to go from the 1th to the 10th percentile, than from the 10th to the 20th. It is easier to go from the 20th to 40th, than 40th to 50th. In fact, it is easier to go from the 50th to 95th, than from the 95th to 98th. If the question was: “should apex pros allocate their time to go from 90th to 92th percentile rotates, or 90th to 92th percentile MM?” the answer is obvious, but this is not the question. Apex players are so much worse at MM compared to almost any other aspect of their gameplay that the effort required to by strafing see non-trivial effects is lower than probably any other aspect (making it: the most effective). It doesn’t help rondon’s case that Apex has almost non-existent practice tools, and that the effectiveness of practising other aspects is poor as a result. The nature of practising strafing is also such that I believe most pros would quite enjoy it, and it would likely serve as a good mental break to prevent burnout.  

  

##### On the artful dodger

The artful dodger is an old man. The artful dodger is a man of principle who is not afraid to go his own direction. He has an intention with every keypress. Every movement or lack thereof has a purpose in mind. The artful dodger is calm and confident in his convictions and abilities to achieve his goals. The artful dodger sees the dance for what it is. The artful dodger puts himself in situations where he has to do little, while his enemy must do a lot. The artful dodge is fluid and merging, always adapting to its surroundings, at any point ready to recede or advance. It is not predetermined and does not follow strict rules that can be forced. The artful dodge is beautiful to watch.



##### On strafeaim

A point on strafeaim for the novice who is trying to orient themselves in this complicated field, please understand that different forms have different characteristics, and are as a result applicable in different situations. Situations that change, very fast. The variables of a fight are not the same at the start and the end of it (for unbelievably trivial reasons). Do not then view strafeaiming as something you go into a fight doing, and committing to it throughout. But be flexible and adapt. Master the forms and use them frequently, but don’t be stubborn. React by feel (as thinking is too slow) when the variables change (which is: always). Do not view your strafing tactic as too static. You should merge in and out of strafeaim often and in a beautiful dance, depending on what your “partner” demands of you in that given millisecond. Please do not misunderstand me, your movement should be intentional and in accordance with the current variables of the situation. In fact, this is precisely what I’m saying. So while you want to be fluid and ready to change up your movement at any time, there has to be a meaningful reason to do so. If the variables are relatively the same throughout, which happens on rare occasions, then for god’s sake do not change a thing. 



##### On practice  

On practice. “A punch is just a punch. A punch is more than a punch. A punch is just a punch.” Most apex pros are currently at the first step, or maybe they’re aware of some basic concepts of strafeaim and such, but they don’t see the full complexity. What you want to do is actively take yourself through the middle step, read, think, and practice the complicated topics until they stop being complicated and start being intuitive and easy again. The goal of practice is to take new and distant ideas and grow familiar with them. Either through sheer experimentation and bruteforce; by simply trying things you have never tried before and seeing how it feels and what it causes. Or by taking concepts that you are more or less convinced of theoretically, and developing a sense of how it feels when applied. Think up ideas on your own and try them extensively in intensive practice, or if you have no ideas: read some and proceed the same.  When playing an important game you do not want to be actively thinking about your movement. Your theoretical convictions (easy to achieve) have to be integrated to such a degree that you can execute them by feel and on autopilot (hard to achieve). To trust your intuition enough to execute a “previously” foreign technique to you in an important game requires substantial practice. And the only feasible way to achieve a high level of mastery of these concepts is with dedicated and intensive such. Quake ffa, LG duel, kovaaks for some concepts and to a slight degree, firing range, r5 deathmatch, Control to a slight degree are all decentish (with the first two being far superior, but unfortunately rapidly dying). You have to actively be thinking during practice. You should deliberately try to geometrically position, strafeaim, have bias in your dodge, or whatever it may be that you’re currently practising (one at a time, of course). Being creative and seeking out means (not only technically but also mentally, ie: you can’t be nervous or outcome-oriented) of intensive practice where you can deliberately try new random shit is imperative to your success. After I read Geometric Positioning seriously for the first time I went on a fake name (because I didn’t want to care about looking bad) and played some hours of lg duel, only thinking about taking angles on my opponent. Next day, same thing. The fights were ridiculous, but I improved a lot. This is a process I’ve done on many aspects: strafeaim, underaiming, dodge, etc. 


##### On attack and defense
“You probe with bayonets. If you find mush, you push. If you find steel, you withdraw”. In fight there is an ever present dance of attack and defence. To probe, find, and push advantages; while never forcing against a well-defended opponent, and always protecting your own weaknesses. Push your enemy at a moment which is hard for him to hit. Bait him into and then abuse his poor positioning. The issue is that most people's toolbox and conceptual understanding is so limited that they mainly just resort to a mindless antimirror-esque left-right spam handshake. Please do not fucking perma handshake. There are always advantages to be found, even in seemingly neutral states. If you’re close-range and your opponent gives you an opportunity (he will, constantly, you just don’t see it) fucking circle him. Literally walk around him in 360 degrees, it has probably never happened to him before. Test your opponent. Check him to see if he’s the real deal or just another noob. Don’t give him so much respect (and disrespect yourself so much) as to handshake every given situation. <* Attack and defence can easiest be understood abstractly in the context of control and domination. For a tangible context it is perhaps best to look at positioning. >* As a sidenote: I believe this concept of probing with bayonets to be very important for gamesense too. It's generally a great strategy to always check your opponents, and if they respond well you retreat, but if they fuck up you punish without a moments hesitation.

  

##### On control and domination

When playing against an inferior opponent, I often experience a sense of mind control. I feel as if I decide what my opponent will do, just an instant before he does, and he rarely does anything I hadn’t pre-decided. I’m always comfortable and never surprised, and there’s a strong calming feeling of pure control. But I’m not a shaman, and really I’m not doing anything particular at all. When you move in a way that the enemy has difficulty aiming at, he will naturally use his movement to make aiming easier: meaning that you just controlled his movement. When an enemy tries to force an attack but you defend well, he is forced to cancel, and: you just controlled his movement. When an enemy is in a poor position and you are taking advantage of it, he is forced to try to leave it in a more or less predictable manner: you just controlled his movement. <quote from tracer guide>

##### On space and bias

It is obvious that apex pros dont understand the simple “concept” of using space. Obvious by the fact that not only do they not apply it themselves, but they also don’t abuse their enemies not doing it. Most apex pros dont use much space in their dodge, they generally stay in around the same area, generally handshaking some antimirror leftright type movement. At the same time, most apex pros don’t underaim a lot, or have calm and controlled aim. These two truths are incompatible with rational agents. <blabla if he doesnt move why dont u underaim, blabla why do u stay same spot he can just underaim>. <This concept is one of those things that you really, really have to see to understand.>

  
  

##### Some trivial thoughts on cover, corners, etc.
Really, this chapter does not fit into the theme of this document, nor is it indicative of good coaching (give a man a fish, etc). [sidenote]:[if all your coach does is teach you a bunch of small tricks, you might consider the fact that he is a fucking scammer. a good coach will primarily teach fundamentals] however i still felt a few simple practical examples would be good for inspiration


  

Artful dodge causes consistency: improves damage foresight/consistency (->improves gamesnse), mitigates nerves in big games, etc. Can almost relate artful dodge with how a controller player works

  

On partners.

If a much better player agrees to play you, be thankful and respectful. Do not whine or waste his time. I’m not saying this because I value respectfulness, but because it is in your interest to do so. <also who to watch>

  
  

If your enemy is uncomfortable or not hitting you, keep going. 

  

Bait your enemy into “”complicated”” situations where you know the correct play, to test them and see if they do. (close to walls, closeness to doors, aggressive pushing, etc)

  

Intentions and goals.

  
  

On simplification and calmness. 

Have the courage to actually play the game and stop being a panicking little baby. Trust your convictions and intuition. Most are too afraid to ever stop left/right-spamming, perma jumping, and even to delay their wingman shot by a few ms. Realise that the game is not that hard. Your target is not that small, and he's not moving that fast. He’s also not hitting that much, and he’s not that good. Simplify the game and view it for what it actually is. Look at what is real rather than what your chicken brain tells you. Most people have a very warped sense of what their enemy can actually do (look at how they aim if you don’t believe me). In most given situations his set of options is quite limited, and they span a small output. Sometimes I see players aim into walls as if expecting their enemy to noclip into it, or flick manically as if they believe their enemy is much faster than he actually is. It is not a matter of “actual” nerves, either. As in: it’s not an issue restricted to important games. Rather, it is a fundamental issue caused by a lack of simplification and ability to see. Simplification in the tangible sense of what you do ingame. Of course, if you flick manically all over the place while spamdodging leftright without strafeaiming, jumping every other second, it will be hard for you to see reality. Your enemy moves across your screen erratically and at high changing speeds. Compare this to the artful dodger, who frequently strafeaims, moves his mouse effectively (both leading to enemy moving slower on his screen), and positions well geometrically (leading to enemy having less options). Controlling your enemy, as discussed earlier, also contributes to simplification.**
