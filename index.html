The goal of this document is to provide the necessary groundwork to
allow for easy self-learning of strafing; by showing you a glimpse of the middle step
and providing you with the technical references necessary to study it. And to explain
the practice necessary to take yourself through the middle step, so that the theory
becomes intuitive and easy.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   As such, the guide is loosely divided in two parts. The first with the
purpose of showing you various surface level ideas in order to inspire your
own thoughts and will to research further, and the second to discuss the
various means of practice and mental approaches to integrate those ideas into
your intuition. I believe that good strafing is very achieveable for anyone
with a decent brain, provided with the proper inspiration, practice, and
effort.

   <div class="epigraph">In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king<hr />
   <div class="episource">
   </div></div>It is obvious that you can get by well as a pro apex player without
great strafing skill. But as a pro player your mentality should not be to
just get by, to do the bare minimum required to secure your little paycheck
and validity. Rather you should always look to seek out edges and strive
to play as closely as you can to the ideal. In any case, it has been shown
that in mechanics-heavy situations (firing range) people with good strafes,
despite their low hours in apex (vF_SERIOUS), outperform top apex pros
<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#whyFoot"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3001f1"></a> - and
indeed people with just decent strafes (myself) will also outperform top pros in these
situations.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#whyFoot"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3002f2"></a> 
And indeed we can look and see that top players like Hardecki and Nafen
have much better strafing skill than their counterparts, and in the case of
                                                                  

                                                                  
Hardecki the effect of strafing seems to have been significant enough that I
could scout him long before he was proven and while others didn&#8217;t see his
potential.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   The argument now <span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#whyFoot"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3003f3"></a> 
is that even if you agree strafing has a non-trivial effect on performance, it&#8217;s indeed
marginal, and time could surely be allocated more effectively. If the question was:
&#8220;should apex pros allocate their time to go from 90th to 92nd percentile rotates, or
90th to 92nd percentile strafing?&#8221; the answer is obvious, but this is not the
question. Apex players are much worse at strafing than other aspects of
their gameplay, meaning that any effort spent to improve strafing will see
significantly more improvement than if it was spent on another aspect (of
course making it: the most efficient). It doesn&#8217;t help the argument&#8217;s case that
Apex has almost non-existent practice tools, and that the effectiveness of
practising other aspects is poor as a result. The nature of practising strafing is
also frankly fun, and would likely serve as a good mental break to prevent
burnout.

<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >The artful dodger is a lazy old man. The artful dodger is a man of principle who is
not afraid to go his own direction. He has an intention with every keypress. Every
movement <span 
class="cmti-10">or lack thereof  </span>has a purpose in mind. The artful dodger is calm and
confident in his convictions and abilities to achieve his goals. The artful dodger sees
the dance for what it is. The artful dodger puts himself in situations where he has to
do little, while his enemy must do a lot. His moves are not predetermined and does
not follow strict rules that can be forced blindly. The artful dodger is fluid
and merging, always adapting to his surroundings, at any point ready to
recede or advance; but ultimately preferring to stay where he is if possible.
<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#artfulFoot><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-4001f4"></a>
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   The artful dodger, relying on concepts and theory, has more consistent damage
input/output (damage taken/dealt) than someone relying only on his mouse control
and ad-spam. This lower variance in input/output allows for more accurate damage
foresight, leading both to better decisions in the moment, and also to long-term
improvement of gamesense as a whole; if your mechanics are consistent, it is easy to
isolate decision making as the main attributor of any given fight&#8217;s success or
failure. This concept-based approach also helps for high pressure games - as
they&#8217;re easier to execute than more strictly mechanical approaches when
nervous.
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   If you want an unfortunately accurate analogy, you can compare the artful dodger

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50004"></a>Intentions and Goals</h3>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >An obvious requirement to strafing well is understanding what goal your strafe is meant
to achieve. There are certain simple goals: maximizing damage dealt, minimizing damage
taken, moving around the map; and more advanced ones: maintaining a good geometric
position<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#goalsFoot"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-5001f5"></a> ,
dodging enemies to your side/above (while maintaining &#8221;proper goal&#8221; to an
enemy in front), or pushing at a certain timing to illicit a response from your
enemy<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#goalsFoot"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-5002f6"></a> .
Begin by focusing your attention on the simpler goals, and the more advanced ones
will come in time as you will have developed the necssary geometric positioning and
strafing skills. Of course, it is rare that we have one and one goal only for
any given situation, more often you&#8217;ll have a hierachy of goals with varying
ratios.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   With true intentful strafing, a lot of the following contents in this document will
come naturally to you. For example, if you think about it enough, it shouldn&#8217;t
be hard to see which purposes your W/S keys, a certain position, or even
standing still could achieve. Consider a 1v1 where you are behind an enemy
in a good position, what is the best strafe? Is there a point in moving at
all?

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60005"></a>Strafeaim</h3>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >AIMER7 has written an excellent document on the topic, and if you&#8217;re feeling rusty
on your knowledge - go read at least pages 1-7. Strafeaim can loosely be explained
as strafing tactics that maximize damage dealt above all else. The most
simple form is the mirror, in which you match the direction your enemy
is moving; meaning that both of you can keep your mouses still and hit
100%<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#strafeFoot"><sup class="textsuperscript">7</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-6001f7"></a> .
Ask yourself when this would be useful? Two answers are when you have more HP, or
a higher dps weapon. You don&#8217;t mind trading hits in these cases, since your enemy
will die before you do. Strafeaim is a very core fundamental which should be the first
thing you practice and grow comfortable with (KovaaK&#8217;s is a useful tool for this).<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#strafeFoot"><sup class="textsuperscript">8</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-6002f8"></a> 





<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >  
    The different strafeaim forms have different characteristics, and are as a result
applicable in different situations. Situations with variables that change very fast. Do
not then view strafeaiming as something you go into a fight doing, and necessarily
committing to throughout. But be flexible and adapt. Master the forms and use them
frequently, but don&#8217;t be stubborn. 

React by feel when the variables change (which is:
almost always). You will merge in and out of strafeaim often and in a beautiful
dance, depending on what your enemies demand of you in that given millisecond.
Your movement should be intentional and in accordance with the current variables of
the situation - so while you want to be fluid and ready to change up your
movement at any time, there has to be a meaningful reason to do so. If the
variables are relatively the same throughout, which happens on rare occasions,
and you have already adopted an optimal strategy, then do not change a
thing.

</div>



<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   Let me present a very reductionist example. Say you enter a fight with mostly
neutral variables, and you begin to anti-mirror your enemy. For the first few
moments it feels as if you both hit relatively the same as each other, and so
you maintain the form. However, a short moment later, your enemy moves
himself into an unfavourable position, leaving him vulnerable to abuse if you
act fast. You move into the geometrically advantageous position (which
means you are no longer strafeaiming), and one of your new goals is now to
maintain this positional advantage. A few moments later he neutralises the
situation, despite your efforts to defend, and you now return to strafeaiming
(presumably, since you had the positional advantage for some time, you
now have an HP advantage and decide to mirror as a means to finish him
off).
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   Again, this is very reductionist, and should not be used as an example of how to
think about the art of strafing. It does, however, illuminate the merging in and out of
strafeaim.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#strafeFoot"><sup class="textsuperscript">9</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-6003f9"></a> 
Strafeaiming should be the default on which you fall back upon, but should be
broken frequently in the pursuit of various measures. The way to achieve this fluidity
is to begin by practising your strafeaim thoroughly, so that you are very comfortable
with all forms and can execute them intuitively and without thinking. After you have
achieved that level of comfort, strafeaiming should be a natural default for
you ingame. As you now begin to practise achieving other goals with your
movement (eg. dodging or geometric positioning) you will do these while
still maintaining the default of strafeaim. This is how the perfect fluidity is
achieved.

   <div class="epigraph">This is why a good dodge is a dodge that tries to move globally in one direction
(modulated by local change of directions) for a relatively long time-scale. This is also
why adad spam [...] is the poorest dodge you can do.<hr />

class="newline" />Tracer Guide p.9</div></div>
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" > 
If there would exist a &#8221;quick-fix&#8221; to get better dodge, it would be to
have a global bias throughout the fight. To, over time, move towards one
side more than the other. Think of it, loosely, as not finishing the fight on
the same spot as you started it. Notice that if you do not use any bias (ie.
your ad-spamming), your enemy can easily &#8220;underaim&#8221; at the middle of
your strafes, hitting a lot with very little effort. By introducing bias you
remove this possibility from him, while forcing him to aim at a larger
angle
<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#biasFoot"><sup class="textsuperscript">10</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-7001f10"></a> . Notice
that &#8221;ras-jumping/kr jumping&#8221; uses strictly zero global bias, and is a result easy to counter with
correct strafing<span class="footnote-mark"><a

and aim strategy.



<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Being able to dodge with a bias also allows one the very important ability to relocate on
the map <span

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7   </span> <a 
 id="x1-80007"></a>Geometry</h3>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >


Be aware of the geometry that you and your enemy reside in. Notice the space where
your enemy can be, and aim accordingly. For example, if your enemy is in a corridor,
you never have to aim closer to the wall than 1 body width. Notice how positioning
in a certain way can limit the amount of space your enemy has on your
screen. Notice how the distance to a corner affects who can see who, and
affects who has control over continuing or cancelling the fight. Notice the
                                                                  

                                                                  
psychological effect of dodging into a wall; your enemy will likely expect
you to dodge back out - you can use that to your advantage. Notice what
certain inputs do when you&#8217;re below an enemy. Notice what distance to
openings does to the available space your enemy has on your screen. Notice that
players tend to feel unreasonably safe right next to cover (&#8221;since they can
hide any time&#8221;), and will dodge there with no bias; giving you many free
hits by just spamming next to the cover. Notice that when an enemy wants
to hide, he&#8217;ll often go towards cover in one straight line. Of course, all of
these scenarios have a reverse complement, where you are in the enemy&#8217;s
shoes.

Push your enemy at a moment and angle which is hard for him to hit; and if he&#8217;s not
hitting, keep going. There are always advantages to be found, even in seemingly
neutral states. If you&#8217;re close-range and your opponent gives you an opportunity,
fucking circle him; walk around him in 360 degrees. Don&#8217;t give him so much respect,
and disrespect yourself so much, as to adad-handshake every given situation. Create a
situation where there is a tangible right and wrong play, that you know but he might
not - geometry is great for this. One example would be bringing the fight to a
doorway, and then making sure to keep further distance from it than the enemy.

15: For the reverse it is important to learn how to aim independently of your movement. If you always mirror your enemy when it gets hard to aim, you’ll be entirely controlled - always following him around

 id="x1-100009"></a>Practice</h3>
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >The goal of practice is to take new ideas and grow familiar with them. Either
through sheer experimentation or by taking concepts that you are more or
less convinced of theoretically, and developing a sense of how it feels when
applied. Think up ideas on your own and try them extensively in intensive
practice.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   Of course, when playing an important game you do not want to be actively
thinking about your movement. Your theoretical convictions (easy to achieve) have to
be integrated to such a degree that you can execute them by feel and on autopilot
(hard to achieve). To trust your intuition enough to execute a &#8220;previously&#8221; foreign
technique to you in an important game requires substantial practice. And the only
feasible way to achieve a high level of mastery of these concepts is with dedicated and
intensive such: Quake lg duel/uht/ca, KovaaK&#8217;s, Firing Range, r5reloaded, Control,
Pubs/Arena are all decentish (with lg and uht being far superior, but unfortunately
rapidly dying).
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   You have to actively be thinking during practice. You should deliberately try to
geometrically position, strafeaim, have bias in your dodge, or whatever it may be
that you&#8217;re currently practising (one at a time, of course). 1v1s lend themselves
naturally to this, as there is a short break between every fight where you have
time to think what you want to practice in the next round. Being creative
and seeking out means (not only technically but also mentally, ie: you can&#8217;t
be nervous or care about looking bad) of intensive practice where you can
deliberately try new random shit is imperative to your success. After I read
Geometric Positioning seriously for the first time I went on a fake name
(because I didn&#8217;t want to care about looking bad) and played some hours
of lg duel, only thinking about taking angles on my opponent. The fights
were ridiculous, but I improved a lot. This is a process I&#8217;ve done on many
aspects.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   Another very underrated thing is to surround yourself with better

Better players often take on the role as a coach to their friends and teammates, and
even if they aren&#8217;t great teachers (or have good understanding), simply 1v1ing them
is good practice for you. Just make sure to not copy him too hard (he&#8217;s
probably not worth copying) or try to win too hard by developing very specific
counter-strategies; always remember to experiment and practice the fundamental
concepts. Of course, when a better player agrees to play you or help you out, be
thankful and respectful. Do not whine or waste his time. I&#8217;m not saying
this because I value respectfulness, but because it is in your interest to do
so.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   Watching top players can also be good. Here I&#8217;d recommend that you
do not attempt to analyze specifics or details until you are very high
skill. Instead, focus on taking in the &#8221;feel&#8221; or &#8221;look&#8221; of their fights, and
try to emulate that. It&#8217;s hard for me to recommend specific players to
watch, since I don&#8217;t know when in the future you&#8217;ll be reading this, but
faye<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="main18.html#fn17x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">17</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-10002f17"></a> 
is a safe bet as an incredibly high skill player. For Apex players you&#8217;ll have to seek
them out on your own; look at who people regard as good and compare them to the
description of the artful dodger.

16: Of course, this is not limited to mechanics. It’s some of the better advice you can give someone trying to improve in general - however with mechanics (and so: 1v1s) it becomes amplified. Granted, as a novice it can be hard to tell who’s truly good, but anyone that is better than you works for now.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1100010"></a>Simplification and Calmness</h3>
<!--l. 102--><p class="noindent" >Have the courage to actually play the game and stop being a panicking
little baby. Trust your convictions and intuition. Many are too afraid to
ever stop ad-spamming, perma jumping, and even to delay their wingman
shot by a few ms. Realise that the game is not that hard. Your target is
not that small, and he&#8217;s not moving that fast. He&#8217;s also not hitting that
much, and he&#8217;s not that good. Simplify the game and view it for what it
actually is. Look at what is real rather than what your chicken brain tells
you.
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   Most people have a very warped sense of what their enemy can actually do (look
at how they aim if you don&#8217;t believe me). In most given situations his set of options
is quite limited, and they span a small output. Be aware of what your enemy wants
or has to do. Realizing e.g. that your enemy wants to hide around a corner, it can
lead to a very easy anti-mirror (to rotate around the corner with him and expose him
for longer) or mirror (if that will finish him off before he disappears). Sometimes I see
players aim into walls as if expecting their enemy to noclip into it, or flick
manically as if they believe their enemy is much faster than he actually
                                                                  

                                                                  
is.
<!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   It is not a matter of &#8220;actual&#8221; nerves, either. As in: it&#8217;s not an issue restricted to
important games. Rather, it is a fundamental issue caused by a lack of simplification
and ability to see. Simplification in the tangible sense of what you do ingame. Of
course, if you flick manically all over the place while ad-spamdodging without
strafeaiming and jumping every other second, it will be hard for you to see reality.
Your enemy moves across your screen erratically and at high changing speeds.
Compare this to the artful dodger, who frequently strafeaims and moves his mouse
effectively (both leading to enemy moving slower on his screen), positions well
geometrically (leading to enemy having less options), and controls his enemy&#8217;s
movement through carefully timed pushes on hard angles (leading to almost
necessary predictability).
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   Of course, calmness requires a certain level of confidence. Being an artful
dodger can be scary, since it doesn&#8217;t <span 
class="cmbx-10">feel </span>like you&#8217;re doing much when you eg.
do a longer strafe or keep your mouse still at the middle of your enemy&#8217;s
strafes, even though they might be the best plays. As such, it takes time
and experience of seeing that these concepts work to develop the sufficient
confidence required to execute them well. A feedback loop at best, a catch-22 at
worst.

<!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >I have to make a strong note here. This document is an inferior version of the
AIMER7 guides, filled with inaccuracies and dumbing-downs, and without the
holistic approach. The AIMER7 guides: Strafe Aiming 101, Heuristic about geometric

<span 
class="cmbxti-10">REALLY REALLY </span>good. I&#8217;ve recommended them to every client I&#8217;ve coached,
and everyone tells me they&#8217;ll read them, the issue is: for some reason they never do.
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve reluctantly written this guide (and why I haven&#8217;t done it
before) - I&#8217;m not the best person for it, and it shouldn&#8217;t even have had to be
written.
<!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   This document is written in a different style to AIMER7&#8217;s guides, hopefully
better suited for the ADHD brains of semi-/pros. It is soaked in artsy, &#8221;Art of War&#8221;,
flimsical bullshit. This is intentional to keep your attention, as is the fact that I
didn&#8217;t talk any real technical details. View this document as an introduction to the
topic, to awaken some thoughts and inspirations in you - but a document which
indeed has to be complemented with the technical texts if you want to achieve real
maturity. Let me repeat myself: this document is to an <span 
class="cmbx-10">overwhelming </span>degree based
on AIMER7&#8217;s writings, and while I have quoted him frequently and at length, you
need to read the source material for the proper holistic understanding. The entire
purpose of this document was to inspire people to go read his guides - I hope it
worked.
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   As a finishing note, it can be difficult to discuss these matters abstractly and
without the context of a real fight. If you&#8217;d like to discuss these topics more tangibly,
